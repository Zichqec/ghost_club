freeshell for etc jam 2024

feel free to mess around in surfaces.txt (sheet cat could even be a kero with that wonky lean...) but please don't majorly edit the images (i. e, change colors, add patterns, add your own bits and bobs.) probably the only minor edit i'd be ok with is if you decided you want to split up the face images so that sheet cat can blink on all blinkable surfaces...
thankies
enjoy
